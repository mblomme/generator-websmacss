# generator-websmacss
This generator aims at basic web applications.
Even small web apps should be written modular en scalable.
Therefore this generator only does scaffolding to get started with SMACCS and Typescript

## CSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS)
The CSS is organized by the SMACSS guidelines and written in SASS with SCSS as extension.

## Typescript
To improve modularity and scalability on the scripting side, the Typescript language
was choosen. Of all the JavaScript alternatives, Typescript was chooses because of it's OO functionality 
and because it is a super set of JavaScript. This eliminates the need of learning a new front-end programming language.

## Optional
Some basic front-end libraries can be includes in the project.
